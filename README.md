## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run in Python 3 with no problems. No additional packages are needed. 

Follwoing are the used libraries:
  - os
  - struct
  - numpy
  - sys
  - sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this example a very simple Neural Network is set up. The idea behind this to show how a Neural Network is set up and implemented instead of using it as a black box. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The file "Neural Network implementation" is a jupyter file in which all code can be found. 

## Theory background <a name="files"></a>


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
The code used here can be find in the book: Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili
